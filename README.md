# CryptoCraft: ERC-20 Token Wizardry

Welcome to CryptoCraft, an innovative project showcasing the creation of a custom ERC-20 token with advanced features using Hardhat, Solidity, and JavaScript.

## Overview

CryptoCraft demonstrates the development of an ERC-20 token with unique features such as staking and burning. Additionally, it includes a basic Decentralized Exchange (DEX) for seamless token swapping.

## Features

- ðŸ›  ERC-20 Token with Staking and Burning
- ðŸ”„ Basic Decentralized Exchange (DEX)

## Project Structure

- **Contracts**: 3 Solidity smart contracts for the ERC-20 token, Stake and DEX.
- **Tests**: JavaScript tests for token functionality (Token.js) and DEX (Dex.js).
- **Deployment Scripts**: Local deployment using deploy.js and deployment on Sepolia testnet using sepoliaTest.js.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Hardhat (install using `npm install hardhat`)

### Installation
